We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery. A consistency-preserving guided DDIM procedure localizes changes while allowing global structural adaptation; multiple candidates can be sampled and selected using a compliance-aware criterion, with optional short SIMP refinement for warps. Across diverse case studies and large edit sweeps, TopoEdit produces intention-aligned modifications that better preserve mechanical performance and avoid catastrophic failure modes compared to direct density-space edits, while generating edited candidates in sub-second diffusion time per sample."}

A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features. Our approach successfully mitigates robustness issues of foundation models for computational pathology without retraining the foundation models themselves, enabling development of robust computational pathology models applicable to real-world data in routine clinical practice."}

We show that exact geodesic distances restricted to the polygon are at most second-order accurate with respect to the distances on the corresponding continuous surface. By order of accuracy we refer to the convergence rate as a function of the average distance between sampled points. Next, a higher-order accurate deep learning method for computing geodesic distances on surfaces is introduced. Traditionally, one considers two main components when computing distances on surfaces: a numerical solver that locally approximates the distance function, and an efficient causal ordering scheme by which surface points are updated. Classical minimal path methods often exploit a dynamic programming principle with quasi-linear computational complexity in the number of sampled points. The quality of the distance approximation is determined by the local solver that is revisited in this paper. To improve state of the art accuracy, we consider a neural network-based local solver which implicitly approximates the structure of the continuous surface. We supply numerical evidence that the proposed learned update scheme provides better accuracy compared to the best possible polyhedral approximations and previous learning-based methods. The result is a third-order accurate solver with a bootstrapping-recipe for further improvement."}

MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video.

To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions.

Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online stabilizers in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving performance comparable to offline methods."}

However, existing methods typically map a single audio stream to a single speaker's motion, without considering social context or modeling the mutual dynamics between two people engaging in conversation. We present DyaDiT, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that generates contextually appropriate human motion from dyadic audio signals. Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation.

High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings."}

While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models. Based on these results, it is argued that the cost-benefit ratio of using multiple cameras is very favorable in most practical use-cases, therefore future research in skeleton-based action recognition should consider multi-view applications as the standard setup."}

We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's \"fading memory\" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption."}

Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability."}

However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG."}

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework."}

It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control."}

This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short.

However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance."}

Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations.

We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data.

We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities."}

While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving."}
